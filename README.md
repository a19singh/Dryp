### Approach used 

The API service is built using flask micro web framework written in and python and deployed on WSGI server.  Beacuse of the nature of being a micro framework the use of flask is done to built the API.

### If you had more time.. 

IF I would not have to get this done within 3-5 hours I would have modiifed, containerized this and would have deployed it on to Heroku or some other platform.
